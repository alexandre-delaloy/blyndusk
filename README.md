# Hello everyone ☕

⏲️ I'm **Alexandre Delaloy**, a *21yo developer addicted to coffee* who's using web languages for more than **3 years**.

🎓 Formerly a **full-time front-end developer**, and after a *[bachelor's degree](https://www.hetic.net/formations/bachelor-web)* at **[HETIC](https://www.hetic.net/) school**, I am currently doing a *[master's degree](https://www.hetic.net/formations/mastere-cto-tech-lead)* also at HETIC to become a **Site Reliability Engineer**. 

> “Site reliability engineers create a bridge between development and operations by applying a software engineering mindset to system administration topics.”

💥 Lately, I am learning **[Golang](https://golang.org/)** for *school* and *personal projects*, while developing in **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)** for *Fogo-Capital*. 

💭 I'd like to free some time to get more interested in **electronics** and projects using **[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)**
